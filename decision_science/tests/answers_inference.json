    "P_VALUE": "\n    p-value is not < 0.05 significance level so median age is not statistically significant at 95% confidence level ;\n    samely, median age is not statistically significant at 90% confidence level, as p-value is not < 0.1 significance \n    level. We can say median age is significally significant at ~ 87.5% confidence level.\n",
